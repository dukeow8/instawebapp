##  system requirements


I developed this fullstack social instagram clone media web app because I wanted to showcase my knowledge of the MERN stack along with Next.js. Initially, I decided to go with Next js. React,because i find it easy to use and the routing is simple and can be deployed with vercel.  Best thing of deploy with vercel like websites is that when you change anything, I mean push a new commit, it will be re-builded and deployed again.I went with the custom Express server since that allowed me to use database (mongoDB).i will also use TailwindCss to style the app,Besides this, this is a simple social media web app. You can create a post, like it, follow other users, comment on posts, delete your post or comment, and so on and so forth. You can try it out here :

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

  The data is static, but fetching from Next's <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction">API Routes</a>. I was fetching data as JSON without use a real api . You can edit the content data from /static/data.js and api will fetch it.
